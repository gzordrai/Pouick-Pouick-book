\section{Company expectations}
The tasks planned for my internship were quite generalist since it
involved writing automatic tests using an "house" tool. The automatic
tests will be set up on equipment allowing voice and signaling to be
converted: analogue <-> digital using RTP (Real Time Protocol) and SIP
(Session Initiation Protocol) protocols.
