\section{Tasks}
The tasks foreseen for the internships are diverse and varied but they
are all necessary for the realization of the internship subject from near or far.
\newline
\newline
First of all I took care of the installation of the project which 
consists in compiling the code, installing the architecture of the
project on the system and starting the necessary services.
\newline
\newline
In a second step I have to write scripts, an export and an import which should allow
to make a backup of the database as well as all the test scripts generated in an archive
in .tar.gz format and therefore also able to import an archive to find these backups.
\newline
\newline
Subsequently I have to modify the application so that it generates test files in python
instead of a Shell script file and consequently update the Shell utility function files
in python.
\newline
\newline
I also have to create a configuration file generator for the machine on which I have to
do the tests in order to generate unique configurations for each test.
\newline
\newline
Finally I have to complete the self-generated test files as well as the tests on the target
machine with the right values and then optimize the tests and the software that generates them.
