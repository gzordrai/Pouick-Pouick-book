\section{Tasks}
The tasks foreseen for the internships are diverse and varied but they
are all necessary for the realization of the internship subject from near or far.
\newline
\newline
First of all I have to take care of the installation of the project which 
consists in compiling the code, installing the architecture of the
project on the system and starting the necessary services.
\newline
\newline
In a second step I have to write two scripts to export and import project data.
The export script should perform a backup of the database and  all the test scripts
generated, in an archive .tar.gz format. The import script should read the archive
and restore the database and all the test scripts.
\newline
\newline
Subsequently I have to modify the application so that it generates test files
in python language instead of Shell script. Consequently I have to convert the Shell
utility function files  into python language.
\newline
\newline
I also have to create a configuration file generator for the machine on which I have to
do the tests in order to generate unique configurations for each test.
\newline
\newline
Finally I have to complete the self-generated test files as well as the tests on the target
machine with the right values and then optimize the tests and the software that generates them.
