\section{Conclusion}
At present, I would say that I have completed 65\% of my tasks to do, I will soon have
fully automated and self-generated tests. The biggest difficulty I had was adapting to the
already existing semi-functional application which was very complex when it could be much
cleaner and less cumbersome.
To conclude I will say that I am a little disappointed with my internship in the sense that
I did not expect from something that already existed, I thought it was up to me to propose a
technical solution from scratch.
Despite this, the team is very friendly and always in a good mood, which makes you want to
work on a daily basis.
