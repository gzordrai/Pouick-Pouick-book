\section{Conclusion}
At present, I would say that I have completed 70\% of planned tasks. I will soon have
fully automated and self-generated tests ready. The biggest difficulty I had was adapting
to the already existing semi-functional application which was very complex.
To conclude I thought I had to propose a technical solution from scratch for the internship subject.
But at the end, I found it quite interesting to adapt and enhance an already existing architecture.
The team I'm working with is very friendly and always in a good mood, which is very pleasant and
makes you happy to work on a daily basis with such people.
